# C# to Class Diagram

Converts class/interface members to Draw.IO XML class diagrams.

## Usage

Add the project path to the entry point at the bottom of the file.

## Known Issues

The text inside the classes do not render correctly (i.e., they appear outside the class shape).

To fix this, move the class block to a new location on the page.
This will cause the text's position to also update.
